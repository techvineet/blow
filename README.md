A nice little application in PHP & jQuery to create tests online. This app gives you the ability to create forms/test on the fly with various question types in the form of Multiple choice questions with single/multiple answers, fill in the blank or true/false etc. You can mark the correct answers while creating a test. Proper validations are in place to take care of human errors while creating tests.

Students can take a test, submit it to see their scores (and can get completion certificate, if required). Administrators can see the reports about tests created sor far, students who have taken the tests etc. from administration area.
